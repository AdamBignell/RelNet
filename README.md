# RelNet
Final project for CMPT 419

Our implementation of the relational network and all relevant models can be found in /baseline/model.py and /baseline/relational.py.

/baseline/social_lstm_model.py and /baseline/nonneural_models.ipynb are two files from the Reddit paper that we use only as reference to ensure we use the same testset.

/relnet contains the implementation of the Santoro paper from https://github.com/kimhc6028/relational-networks, and is used primarily as reference, although we begin with portions of model.py to start our model.
